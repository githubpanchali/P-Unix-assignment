- **Data Inspection**: Utilized `awk`, `du`, `wc`, and `grep` to inspect attributes of `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` and `snp_position.txt`, identifying column counts, file sizes, and contents.
- **Data Processing for Maize and Teosinte**: Filtered genotype data by groups, transposed, sorted, and joined with SNP position data. Generated multiple files for each species based on SNP positions and chromosome numbers, including handling of unknown and multiple positions.
- **Chromosome Files Generation**: For both maize and teosinte, produced files for each chromosome, with SNPs ordered by increasing and decreasing positions, and handled missing data with specific symbols.
- **Output Files**: Created distinct files for SNPs with unknown and multiple positions, and for each chromosome, detailed files with SNPs ordered by position, ensuring data integrity and accessibility for further analysis.
